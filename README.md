# MoodGuard-Server
 A simple proof-of-concept Python HTTP server created for the MoodGuard chrome extension.

# How to install the server
Clone the repository into a folder of your choosing. In order for the server to work properly and download images, you need to ensure that you create an empty folder titled 'server-images' within the same directory as http_server.py.

# How to run the server
To run the server, you can use your terminal to change directories to where your server has been downloaded. Once you're in the correct working directory, simply type:
```python http_server.py```
